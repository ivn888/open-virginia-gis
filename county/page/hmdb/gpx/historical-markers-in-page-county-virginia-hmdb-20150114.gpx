    <desc><![CDATA[In mid-June 1862, after Maj. Gen. Thomas J. &#8220;Stonewall&#8221; Jackson’s Shenandoah Valley campaign, Brig. Gen. Beverly H. Robertson’s cavalry screened from Union observation Jackson’s movement east to join the Army of Northern Virginia near Richmond. Robertson posted two companies of cavalry here, half a mile north of Luray. On 29 June, a Federal reconnaissance force of Maine, Michigan, and Vermont cavalry rode south from Front Royal to locate Jackson. About 9:00 A.M. on 30 June, the Union cavalry charged the outnumbered Confederates and dispersed them. Not finding Jackson, who unknown to them, had left the Valley, the Federals returned to Front Royal.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[On May 21, 1862. Confederate Gen. Thomas J.
&#8220;Stonewall&#8221; Jackson’s Valley Army plodded north
along this road to threaten Front Royal and out
flank Union Gen. Nathaniel Bank’s position at Strasburg. With the addition of Gen. Richard S.
Ewell’s division, Jackson’s command numbered
nearly 17,000 men and 50 guns. Philip Kauffman,
a young man at the time, remembered the Confederates as they crossed the Shenandoah River
on the White House Bridge and: <i>&#8220;...Stonewall
himself as he ran the gauntlet, with bared head,
through the marching columns of his ‘foot cavalry.’
His faded gray uniform with stars on the collar,
his black beard and uncovered head, as he loped
by the White House on Old Sorrel, are as fresh
in my mind as on that day.&#8221;</i>
<br><br>
Jackson’s Valley Army reached Front Royal
May 23. There, aided by spy Belle Boyd, it overwhelmed Banks’ 1,000-man detachment and
continued toward Winchester to attack the main
Union army, now in full retreat from Strasburg.
Jackson’s success was complete. He had defeated
and driven Banks from the Valley and alarmed
the Lincoln administration. In response to Jackson’s bold moves, a two-pronged Federal advance
was to converge at Strasburg in an attempt to
cut off Jackson’s line of withdrawal south.
<br><br>
Jackson marched south to escape. Two
Federal columns followed in close pursuit&#8212;Gen.
John C. Fremont on the Valley Pike and Gen.
James Shields in the Page Valley. If Shields could
march quickly enough to overtake Jackson's force
in the main Valley. he and Fremont could unite
and attack with a superior force. To prevent this
combination, Jackson ordered his cavalry commander, Turner Ashby, to destroy both the White
House and Columbia bridges. Ashby dispatched
Capt. Samuel Coyner’s Page County Company
which rode through &#8220;one of the most dreadful
thunderstorms&#8221; in time to burn the White House
Bridge at 4 a.m. on June 2&#8212;only one hour before
Shields’ advance guard reached the swollen river.
Shields, delayed for three days by the rising river,
was forced to abandon his plan to join Fremont
at New Market. Jackson defeated Fremont’s and
Shields’ commands separately at Cross Keys and
Port Republic June 8-9.
<br><br>
White House Bridge takes its name from
the small building immediately north of the
present-day bridge. This early structure was the
first home of pioneer Martin Kauffman. For a time
it served as a meeting house where, as a minister,
Kauffman served a Mennonite congregation.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[In September 1864, Union Gen. Philip H. Sheridan detached two cavalry divisions under Gen. Alfred T. A. Torbert to move into the Page Valley. While the bulk of Sheridan’s army would strike Gen. Jubal A. Early’s Confederates at Fisher’s Hill, Torbert was to cross Massanutten Mountain and cut off Early’s avenue of retreat.
<br><br>
This maneuver first met resistance from well-entrenched Confederate cavalry at Milford (present-day Overall) on September 22. Unsuccessful at breaking the line, Torbert withdrew to Front Royal. By September 24, however, Torbert had learned of Sheridan’s victory at Fisher’s Hill and quickly marched towards Luray, catching up with remnants of Confederate cavalry under Col. William H. Payne here around Yager’s Mill.
<br><br>
Gen. George A. Custer and Col. Charles R. Lowell, Jr. attacked Payne’s brigade with two Federal cavalry brigades and artillery. Badly outnumbered and outgunned, the Confederates retreated to Honeyville before moving on to Port Republic. 
<br><br>
Although Torbert continued across Massanutten Mountain, he was too late to cut off the Confederate retreat. Years after the war, Sheridan recollected that he could never &#8220;account satisfactorily for Torbert’s failure.&#8221;
<br><br>
<i>(sidebar)</i> Private Phillip James Baybutt, a native Englishman and member of the 2nd Massachusetts Cavarly, received this Medal of Honor for seizing the regimental flag of the 6th Virginia Cavalry in action here. Despite having received this distinction, Baybutt was denied a veteran’s pension following his return to England after the war.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[On October 2, 1864, elements of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry Division under Col. William H. Powell reached this area near Luray and quickly laid waste to the Willow Grove Mill. Amanda Moore, wife of the mill’s owner, later recalled, "We had the Mill, Saw Mill, barn ... and all the stabling, granary, corn crib, and everything burnt ... the barns were full of wheat and also there was a great deal in the Mill.&#8221;<br><br>
In addition to Willow Grove, several other flour mills, barns, sawmills, stables, tanneries and lumberyards in Page County also fell under the torch within the next 36 hours.<br><br>
These events and others like them, were part of Gen. Philip Sheridan’s infamous &#8220;burnings&#8221; in the Shenandoah Valley.<br><br>
By the time Powell departed five days later, the county had sustained well over $1 million in damages.<br><br>
By October 24, citizens of Page County petitioned the Confederate government for relief from conscription stating that there was "just sufficient reason to fear starvation will be the fate of some of our citizens should the call for all men be enforced."<br><br>
<i>(sidebar)</i><br>
 <b>Willow Grove and Mundellsville</b><br>
Prior to the establishment of the town of Luray in 1812, Willow Grove Mill was the focal point of the thriving village of Mundellsville. Powered by an 18-foot overshot water wheel, the mill was a prime example of the quality mills that later earned the Valley the title of &#8220;Bread Basket of the Confederacy.&#8221; Another superb example of a period mill survived the &#8220;burnings&#8221; and still stands at Edinburg in Shenandoah County.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Having successfully driven Gen. Nathaniel Bank's Union army from the Shenadoah Valley in late May 1862, Gen. Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson's "foot cavalry" had little time to reset. While one Union army under Gen. John C. Frémont was bearing down from the north, another under Gen. James Shields was passing toward the Page Valley. If Shields could move quickly enough to overtake Jackson's force in the main valley, he and Frémont could unite and attack with a superior force. Accordingly, Jackson made a rapid retreat along the Valley Pike toward Harrisonburg. In order to delay Shield's advance, Jackson ordered the destruction of the White House and Columbia Bridge in the Page Valley. As a result, Shields was delayed for three days and was forced to abandon the plan to cross the Massanutten and unite with Frémont. By June 7, elements of Shield's army began moving toward Port Republic, crossing Naked Creek along the road to your right.<br><br>In the days that followed, Jackson defeated the two armies in piece meal fashion, first Frémont at Cross Keys on June 8, then Shields at Port Republic on June 9. Both Federal armies were forced to retreat along the routes by which they had arrived. On reaching this area near Price's Mill (a later mil stands on its site), Shields' defeated army finally came to a halt and bivouacked before continuing the march to Luray on June 10, and on the Front Royal a week later.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Nearly a month after the battle of Kernstown, Gen. Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson's command had worked its way south "up" the Valley to join Gen. Richard S. Ewell's division near Conrad's Store (Elkton). To secure this haven for reorganization, on April 19, 1862, Jackson dispatched his mapmaker Jedediah Hotchkiss, to burn the three bridges over the South Fork of the Shenandoah River in Page County.<br><br>From the onset, Hotchkiss' chore was plagued with problems. In addition to heavy rains, a number of the 150 cavalrymen that Hotchkiss had joined for the assignment at Shenandoah Iron Works were under the influence of the spiritous liquor "apple-jack." In the end, the Red Bridge was the only one to be burned while the destruction of Columbia and White House bridges was thwarted by the combination of apple-jack and Federal resistance.<br><br>Already angered by the overall lack of discipline in his cavalry, on April 24, Jackson reassigned the Valley cavalry to two of the army's infantry brigade commanders. Infuriated, the cavalry commander Col. Turner Ashby submitted his resignation and immediately caused a rift in Jackson's command. In the end, Jackson, as one staff member wrote, backed "square down." Jackson could not afford the loss of a leader that was so popular among the men and effective in battle, especially on the verge of a major campaign.<br><br><i>(Sidebar):</i> Hotchkiss had pre-war ties to Page County, having taught several children of the Forrer family and others at Mossy Creek Academy in Augusta County. One former student commanded the companies during the bridge burning expedition and left Hotchkiss to write: <i>"I am sorry, truly sorry, that Macon Jordon was in such a condition yesterday. I do not know what may become of [it] to him..."</i>]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Early in May 1862, Gen. Stonewall Jackson moved most of his army east over the Blue Ridge toward Charlottesville, leaving Gen. Richard S. Ewell's division at Conrad's Store (present day Elkton) to hold the Federals in the Shenandoah Valley. The Union commanders suspected that Jackson was en route to Richmond. They did not know, however, that he had turned back on May 3 and four days later was west of Staunton. On May 8, he defeated Federal forces at the Battle of McDowell.<br><br>During the period of uncertainty, Gen. Jeremiah C. Sullivan, guarding nearby Columbia Bridge, ordered Col. Robert S. Foster's 13th Indiana Infantry to reconnoiter here to "burned bridge" (Red Bridge) on the morning of May 7. After marching 2 1/2 miles past Honeyville, Foster encountered Gen. Richard Taylor's Louisiana brigade and supporting Virginia cavalry. Driving the Confederates back to Dogtown, Sullivan retired to Columbia Bridge again the next morning.<br><br>Meanwhile, a company of Vermont cavalry, instead of bringing up the Federal rear, stumbled into the "reserve of the enemy" farther upriver. Foster's regiment quickly countermarched and engaged Confederate forces near here "for a half-hour under a most terrific fire." Ultimately, the Vermonters were able to swim the Shenandoah River to safety. <br><br>The engagement left 29 Federals killed, wounded, captured, and missing. Confederate losses included at least two killed and an unspecified number captured.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Nearly three weeks after the Battle of Gettysburg, and in the wake of a sharp fight near Front Royal at Wapping Heights (Manassas Gap) on July 23, 1863, Confederate troops from Gen. Richard S. Ewell’s corps withdrew to the Page Valley. On July 25, Gen. Robert E. Rodes’ division camped near Bethlehem Lutheran Church (otherwise known as Brick Church) and along Pass Run. Gen. Edward &#8220;Allegheny&#8221; Johnson’s division camped near Rodes, while Gen. Jubal A. Early’s division spent the night at Mt. Jackson.<br><br>The soldiers rested the following day, a Sunday, and many attended the Rev. Beverly Tucker Lacy’s sermon at headquarters that morning. Before Stonewall Jackson’s death near Chancellorsville that spring, Lacy had been his &#8220;field&#8221; minister. Later that evening, the army began to move, and Early’s division marched through the Luray/New Market Gap into the Page Valley to join the balance of Ewell’s corps.<br><br>On the morning of July 27, leaving several of the wounded from Gettysburg and Wapping Heights in Luray in the care of private citizens, Rodes’ and Johnson’s division crossed Thornton Gap into Rappahannock County; Early soon joined them. In the weeks that followed, during what became known as the Bristoe Campaign, both armies fought a series of engagements well into October.<br><br><i>(sidebar)</i> Bethlehem Lutheran Church. Closely affiliated with Hebron Church in Madison County, the congregation built the brick structure in 1851. During the Civil War, local residents called it Pass Run Church.]]></desc>

    <desc><![CDATA[Built in 1846, Catherine Furnace was one of three Page County furnaces in operation during the Civil War. The 30-foot-tall main stack is nearly all that remains of the cold blast furnace and once-huge operation here, when 22,500 acres supplied wood for charcoal, iron ore, and limestone, and food. With labor scarce, local whites, free blacks and slaves worked here to furnish the Confederacy with pig iron.
<br><br>
Wagons transported the pig iron to Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, the &#8220;Ironmaker of the Confederacy&#8221; and largest such operation in the South. The furnace also produced solid cannon shot and perhaps a few cannon tubes. Furnace #2 on Naked Creek made cannon balls as well. 
<br><br>
Ironmaster Noah Foltz, a secret Union sympathizer, helped Federal soldiers escape from Page County, across the Massanutten Mountain to Fort Valley. After he mistakenly helped Confederates disguised as Union soldiers &#8220;escape,&#8221; however, Foltz was arrested but was soon released on bond to continue work at the furnace. The 1st Vermont Cavalry made the only known attempt to destroy the furnace on May 7, 1862. However, because of the ensuing engagement at Somerville Heights, the cavalry contingent never reached here.]]></desc>

Thomas J. &#8220;Stonewall&#8221; Jackson moved through Page County toward Fisher’s Gap to rejoin the main body of the Army of Northern Virginia, then near Fredericksburg. Jackson was in command of the newly organized Second Corps, with more than 32,000 troops.<br><br>Crossing the South Fork of the Shenandoah River at Columbia Bridge, the long columns of gray took nearly four days to move along the facing road (New Market-Gordonsville Turnpike) before exiting the Page Valley.<br><br>Private John H. Worsham of the 21st Virginia Infantry later wrote of the crossing:<i>Near the top, as we were marching, there was a rock, and looking back and down the road, we could see six lines of our army; in one place infantry, in another artillery, in another ambulances and wagons. Some seemed to be coming towards us, some going to the right, some to the left, and some going away from us. They were all, however, climbing the winding mountain road, and following us.&#8221;</i><br><br>Bivouacking for the night at the nearby village of Hawksbill, Jackson resumed the march the following morning. At the top of the Blue Ridge, he was said to have looked back upon his troops and his beloved Valley that he had so staunchly defended. Less than six months later, Jackson was accidently shot by his own men and soon died from complications. He would return to the Valley to be laid to rest in Lexington on May 15, 1863.<br><br><i>(Sidebar):</i> The land for Graves’ Chapel Methodist Church was conveyed in 1860 by Paschal Graves who helped construct the New Market-Gordonsville Turnpike. During the winter of 1863-1864 the chapel served briefly as a field hospital. The two graves in front of you are testimony to the passing of Confederate troops through this area at that time.

    <desc><![CDATA[Having remained with his command
in the vicinity of Winchester since the
Battle of Sharpsburg/Antietam, by
November 22, 1862, Gen. Thomas J.
&#8220;Stonewall&#8221; Jackson was again on
the march. With more than 32,000
soldiers, Jackson’s force made its
way up the snow-covered Shenan
doah Valley toward New Market and
then toward Columbia Bridge by
way of this gap.
<br><br>
On reaching a point atop Massanutten Mountain, sometime late
in the evening on November 23,
Jackson took the rare opportunity
to rest and made camp nearby. In
the brisk air of the following morning, as his staff admired a command
ing view of the Page Valley below,
Jackson emerged from his tent and
unintentionally prompted his staff
to redirect their awe upon the old
hero of Manassas. Having recently
been promoted to lieutenant general
and wearing a new coat given him
by General J.E.B. Stuart, a tall hat
purchased by his mapmaker, Jedediah Hotchkiss, and a captured sword
donated by a cavalryman, Jackson
ignored the stares and boldly
announced to his staff, &#8220;Young gentlemen, this is no longer the headquarters of the Army of the Valley,
but of the Second Corps of the
Army of Northern Virginia.&#8221;
<br><br>
The march that followed in the
succeeding days took the new corps
across the South Fork of the Shenandoah at the site of the Columbia
Bridge near Alma, across Fisher’s
Gap, and out of the Valley in order
to rendezvous with Gen. Robert E.
Lee and the main body of the Army
of Northern Virginia. Less than
three weeks later, Jackson’s Corps
would be holding the Confederate
right flank as Federal forces under General Ambrose Burnside unsuccessfully attempted to dislodge Lee from his strong line of defense at the Battle of Fredericksburg, Virginia on December 13, 1862.]]></desc>

The nine-mile Elizabeth River Trail, which runs from Norfolk State University following the Elizabeth River northward to Terminal Boulevard, began with an abandoned railroad spur being transformed into a walking and bicycle trail. The Atlantic City Spur section of the trail neighbors the Midtown Tunnel and adjacent Plum Point Park. The Trail can be accessed at various points along the Elizabeth River to include the Waterside Festival Marketplace, the end of Southampton Avenue near the public health building, or at Claremont Avenue near Raleigh Avenue in West Ghent. The trail offers scenic views of the Elizabeth River and interpretive markers tell the history of the area and environment. For more information and a map of the complete trail visit norfolk.gov/bike.

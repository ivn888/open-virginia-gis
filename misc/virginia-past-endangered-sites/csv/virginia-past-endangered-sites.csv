Africa Freedom of Information Centre (AFIC),#icon-960-4186F0,12085f34,"This first issue provides a reflection of progress African countries have made in advancing the right to information from a regional perspective. Specifically, countries are assessed on the state of ratification and domestication of African Union treaties that recognize the right to information, status of treaty reporting in terms of Article 62 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights as well as adoption of freedom of information laws in line with article IV of Declaration of Principles of Freedom of Expression in Africa. In addition, activists provide their first hand experiences with access to information in respective countries. ""Ratification, domestication and effective implementation of regional treaties that recognize peoples' right to information is essential for continental integration, democracy and security. Countries where there has been little or no progress on this agenda have experienced tension and conflict. Unfortunately, whereas there have been calls by African leaders for Africa to resolve its issues, many countries have not ratified key African treaties on access to information while a good number do not respect reporting obligations"". Says Gilbert Sendugwa, AFIC's Executive Director. Given the centrality of access to information in promoting transparency, accountability, rule of law, democracy, peace and security, AFIC calls upon all stakeholders including African Union, Governments and civil society to prioritize the advancement of the right to information in Africa.<br><br>http://africafoicentre.org/index.php/resources/reports-publications/139-state-of-right-to-information-in-africa-report-2014<br><br>Event: Launch: State of the Right to Information in Africa Report<br><br>When: 29 September 2014 <br>","Launch: State of the Right to Information in Africa Report

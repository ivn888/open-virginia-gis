This dataset contains Beach Act Geospatial data as Google Earth KMZ files. This data is based on state provided latitude /longitude coordinates and has not been corrected to display on the shoreline image shown in Google earth.  The following jurisdictions are not represented in the KMZ files: Alaska (AK), American Samoa (AS), and Guam (GU).  

The files are organized by state and can be used in the free Google Earth application.  To use these files download Google Earth from: http://earth.google.com/download-earth.html.  Download the KMZ file of interest to your hard drive, http://www.epa.gov/waters/data/beach_act_kmz.zip.  The .zip file includes the 2009 Swimming Season Geospatial Data.xls file which contains data such as Beach ID (assigned by EPA), beach name, county, latitude and longitude coordinates, and length. Open Google Earth, go to File\open, and browse for your file then click open file.  In the Google Earth earth side bar, open the jurisdiction folder(s). 

The Beaches will be represented by blue lines with pushpins at the start and end points of the beach.   Clicking on the pushpins will bring up a text box that contains beach name, EPA Beach ID and County.  By defaults the KMZ file is saved in Temporary places, so at end of your session, decide if you want to save in Google Earth.  

If you recive any errors when you try to open a Google Earth file, just click OK and the file should open.

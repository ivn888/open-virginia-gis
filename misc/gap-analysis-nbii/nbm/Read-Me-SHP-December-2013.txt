Note: Because data was originally submitted in a file geodatabase and exported to SHP for download, this data may look slightly different in this format than how it is displayed on BroadbandMap.gov. The HOCONUM and HOCONAME field values, were added during the data integration proccess and are a holding company roll-up based on the FCC Registration Numbers (FRNs). This allows you to identify unique providers accross the country. For a complete description of how the data was collected, please refer the NOFA, Technical Appendix, and NOFA clarification, which can be found here: http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/notices#mapping . 

When citing data, it should read, "US Dept of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration, State Broadband Initiative (SHP format December 31, 2013)."

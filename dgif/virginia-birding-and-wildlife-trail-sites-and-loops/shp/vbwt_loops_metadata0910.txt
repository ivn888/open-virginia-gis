  Description:
    Abstract: This dataset contains locational information for Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries' (VDGIF) Virginia Birding & Wildlife Trail. The coverage includes all of Virginia. These data were compiled by the VDGIF Geographic Information Systems section from information created by the Watchable Wildlife Section. These data are presented as lines within an ESRI shapefile.
    Purpose: This dataset shows Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries Birding & Wildlife Trail loops of the trail.
    Supplemental_Information: The VBWT Sites are a separate GIS dataset.

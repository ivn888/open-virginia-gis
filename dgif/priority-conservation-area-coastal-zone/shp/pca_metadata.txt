  Description:
    Abstract: The Priority Conservation Area (PCA) dataset delineates priorty conservation areas ranked by level of importance based on VA DGIF Priority Wildlife Diversity Conservation Areas, VA Dept of Conservation and Recreation Division of Natural Heritage Conservation Sites Layer (CSL) and Natural Lands Network (NLN), and VCU Center for Environmental Studies aquatic resource integrity layer.  Priority Conservation Areas are defined as lands and surface waters indentified as important for conservation of Virginia's wildlife, plants, and natural communities.  The identified lands/waters can be used to prioritize areas for preservation, protection or specific management action.
    Purpose: This dataset was developed to synthesize important natural resource information in one geospatial layer for natural resource management, land use management and awareness.
    Supplemental_Information: This dataset is intended to guide conservation planning and efforts.  This dataset is not intended to replace on the ground surveys or consultations with biologists as appropriate.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Data are as accurate as input datasets at the time of creation.  Data were reviewed by biologists internally at respective agencies.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: These data are as consistent as the input datasets.
  Completeness_Report: No warranty, expressed or implied, is made regarding the accuracy, adequacy, completeness, reliability, or usefulness of any data provided. These data are provided on an "as is" basis. All warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular use, freedom from computer viruses, and non-infringement of proprietary rights, are disclaimed. Data are added and changed periodically, and data may become out-of-date quickly. It is recommended that the user not let a significant period of time elapse between obtaining and using the data. Data was comprised using the most current listings of public lakes from http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/fishing/waterbodies/ . These listings are subject to frequent and unanounced changes, which may affect lake status.
  Lineage:
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Priority Wildlife Diversity Conservation Areas were developed by the VA Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. Data from habitat maps, Colonial Waterbird surveys, DCR's VCLNA, USGS National Hydrography Dataset, USFWS National Wetlands Inventory, Audubon's Important Bird Areas, and other datsets were compiled using input from DGIF biologists and guidance from the Wildlfie Action Plan.  Data was created in GRID format and ranks were associated with the data from a scale of 1 (low priority) to 5 (high priority).

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The CSL delineates known habitats of rare plants and animals, and exemplary natural communities, as well as surrounding habitat necessary to maintain these resources.  In the CSL source dataset, each Virginia Natural Heritage Conservation Site is assigned a biodiversity significance rank (b-rank) based upon the rarity, viability, and diversity of the resources it contains, ranging from a high of 1 to a low of 5.  For the PCA analysis, b-ranks were transposed so that highest b-rank Virginia Natural Heritage Conservation Sites (rank 1, Outstanding Biodiversity Significance) maintained a high priority PCA analysis ranking of 5.  The NLN is a spatial subset of lands ranked and summarized in the Virginia Natural  Landscape Assessment (VaNLA), consisting of all ecological cores in the two highest categories of the VaNLA, outstanding and very high ecological integrity rankings.  In addition to the top two rank classes of cores, the NLN includes landscape corridors and nodes that connect highest ranking cores.  For the PCA analysis, NLN Ecological Integrity Scores were transposed so that highest ranked lands (rank 1, Outstanding Ecological Integrity) maintained a high priority PCA analysis ranking of 5.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The aquatic resource integruty layer was developed by VCU Center for Environmental Studies using INSTAR stream reaches and a modified index of biotic integrity.  The National Hydrography Dataset (high resolution) was assigned a watershed integrity value based on the mIBI.  INSTAR reaches were buffered based on stream order and assigned a rank based on the INSTAR VSS score.  The datasets were mosaiced together to create a blue infrastructure layer with ranks of 2(low integrity) - 5 (high integrity).

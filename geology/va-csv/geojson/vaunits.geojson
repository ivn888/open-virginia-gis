Primary sedimentary structures rarely are preserved. A spectacular polymictic breccia bed that can be traced along strike for several miles within the Fork Mountain near Stuart is a notable exception.

Geophysical signature: The Fork Mountain has a characteristic \"curly maple\" pattern on magnetic contour maps. This pattern is the result of isolated concentrations of highly magnetic minerals that produce rounded, high-intensity, positive and negative anomalies. The aluminosilicate-mica schist is the upper part of the Fork Mountain Formation and forms a series of northeastward-\u000btrending ridges along the northwest side of the Smith River allochthon. The garnetiferous biotite gneiss is at a lower structural level of the Fork Mountain Formation near Martinsville where lower strata have been intruded by the Martinsville igneous complex, and the remaining metasedimentary rocks contain extensive thermal meta mor phic zones\u000blocallized along the intrusive contacts (Conley and Henika, 1973). Biotite gneiss in the Fork Mountain Formation has been interpreted to be a highly metamorphosed diamictite\u000b(Rankin, 1975; Conley, 1985; and Pavlides, 1989). At the northeastern limit of the Fork Mountain outcrop belt, in Appomattox and Buckingham counties, the dominant lithologies are polydeformed yellowish-gray chloritoid-chlorite- muscovite quartzose phyllite and quartz-rich mica schist. Tightly-folded, transposed pinstriped segregation layering at a high angle to the penetrative schistosity defined by phyllosilicate minerals is characteristic; polycrystalline quartz-rich boudins are abundant. These rocks are lithologically indistinguishable from those along the highly-tectonized western margin of the metagraywacke, quartzose schist, and melange (CZpm) outcrop belt; current interpretation is that the Fork Mountain is correlative to some degree with CZpm.\u000b\u000b", "MAP_REF": "VA003", "ROCKTYPE1": "mica schist", "ROCKTYPE2": "gneiss", "ROCKTYPE3": "quartzite; melange", "UNIT_REF": "VA001\u000bVA002 \u000bVA003" }, "geometry": null },

Furcron (1939) mapped both high- and low-titanium breccias as Warrenton agglomerate; R.L. Smith (personal communication in Espenshade, 1986) interpreted the breccias as subareal agglutinates. Kline and others (1990) presented evidence that the breccias are hyaloclastite pillow breccias, erupted in a subaqueous environment. Reed (1955) recognized a mappable stratigraphy within the Catoctin, and made the interpretation that the greenstones were metamorphosed tholeiitic flood basalts that originated in a \"nonorogenic\" setting. Rankin (1975) considered the Catoctin to have originated during continental volcanism associated with the opening of a proto-Atlantic Iapetus ocean in Latest Precambrian time, and included the Catoctin in the Crossnore volcanic-plutonic group. Badger and Sinha (1988) studied chemical stratigraphy within individual fl ows and dated Catoctin metabasalts at 570 ñ 36 Ma using Rb-Sr systematics on samples showing little evidence of elemental mobility during metamorphism. This date is consistent with radiometric age data from Catoctin metarhyolite, discussed above, and with the occurrence of Early Cambrian-age Rusophycus stratigraphically above the Catoctin near the base of the Chilhowee Group (Simpson and Sundberg, 1987). These constraints suggest that some portion of the Catoctin may be as young as Cambrian in age. Regional mapping suggests that metabasalts and amphibole gneisses within the Ashe (Zaa), Alligator Back (CZas), and Bassett Formations (CZba) are volcanogenic rocks that are correlative with the Catoctin in a lithostratigraphic sense and in terms of tectonic setting, but not necessarily in a strict time sense.

An Upper Ordovician age for the Arvonia has been established from fossils collected by Watson and Powell (1911), Stose and Stose (1948), Tillman (1970), and Kolata and Pavlides (1986). The Arvonia has long been considered unconformable on top of adjacent units. Micaceous quartzite, pebbly mus covite schist, and conglomeratic schist are common at the base of the section where that boundary is not faulted (Stose and Stose, 1948; Smith and others, 1964; Brown, 1969; Evans and Marr, 1988). The base of the Arvonia is exposed in an old railroad cut near Carysbrook, Fluvanna County (Smith and others, 1964); there, a micaceous quartzite containing quartz pebbles rests on granite of the Carysbrook pluton. The Stoses (1948) considered the Arvonia a sequence deposited on a post-Taconic-orogeny regional unconformity, and folded and metamorphosed during subsequent orogenies; that interpretation is consistent with geologic constraints as we know them today. The Arvonia is correlated with the Quantico Formation. History of the Arvonia district slate industry is discussed by Brown (1969) and Evans and Marr (1988).\u000b", "MAP_REF": "VA003", "ROCKTYPE1": "slate", "ROCKTYPE2": "schist", "ROCKTYPE3": "", "UNIT_REF": "VA001 \u000bVA002\u000bVA003" }, "geometry": null },

Geophysical signature: diffuse magnetic lows and radiometric highs. The pluton was originally named Columbia Granite by Jonas (1928); this name was objected to by later workers because of the relatively small percentage of true granite present. The pluton includes the southeastern portion of the granodiorite unit of Smith and others (1964). Granitic rocks in the Carysbrook area of Fluvanna County are here considered part of a separate Carysbrook pluton, following the usage of Stose and Stose (1948). The Columbia includes, in part, the Hatcher complex of Brown (1969). Bourland and Glover (1979) refer to the pluton as the Columbia metagranite. Given the heterogeneous nature of the pluton, multiple intrusive phases are likely present.\t Tonalite in the eastern part of the pluton has yielded ages of 590+\/-80 Ma, (Rb-Sr whole-rock; Fullagar, 1971). Mose and\u000bNagel (1982) report a Rb-Sr whole-rock age for the Columbia of 454ñ9 Ma.

Plagioclase contains abundant prismatic epidote and white mica; ilmenite is rimmed with masses of anhedral titanite; subhedral hornblende and subhedral to euhedral almandine-grossular garnet occur locally. In the vicinity of adjacent charnockite, anhedral actinolitic amphibole pseudomorphs after pyroxene or rims thoroughly uralitized relict pyroxene. Rock fabric is gradational from granofels to mylonite gneiss. Geophysical signature: negative magnetic signature relative to adjacent charnockite. In northern Virginia, this unit strongly resembles prophyroblastic granite gneiss (Ybp); however, the augen in Ybp are more commonly polycrystalline aggregates rather than single-crystal porphyroblasts. This unit is widespread in the central and southeastern Blue Ridge, encompassing a number of lithologically similar metaplutonic entities: the \"biotitic facies\"of the Roses Mill and Turkey Mountain ferrodiorites of Herz\u000band Force (1987), the Archer Mountain quartz monzonite of Bartholomew and others (1981), biotite granofels and augen gneiss of Evans (1984, 1991), biotite augen gneiss of Conley (1989), and augen-bearing gneiss of Lukert and Halladay (1980), and Lukert and Nuckols (1976). Historically, most workers have interpreted these rocks as Grenville-age plutons in which the present-day biotite-rich mineral assemblage is a primary igneous assemblage that crystallized from a melt (for example, Bartholomew and others, 1981). Herz and Force (1987) and Evans (1991) presented evidence that these biotite gneisses were derived from charnockite plutons by retrograde hydration reactions.\t\u000bPettingill and others (1984) reported ages of 1009ñ26 Ma (Rb-Sr whole-rock) and 1004ñ36 Ma (Sm-Nd whole-rock) for ferrodiorite to quartzmonzonite in the Roseland district. Where this unit has been mapped in the Upperville quadrangle (A.E. Nelson, unpublished data), U-Pb zircon data suggest a crystallization age of 1055ñ2 Ma (Aleinikoff and others, 1993).\u000b", "MAP_REF": "VA003", "ROCKTYPE1": "augen gneiss", "ROCKTYPE2": "", "ROCKTYPE3": "", "UNIT_REF": "VA001\u000bVA002\u000bVA003" }, "geometry": null },

VA002):\u000bDiana Mills complex (Brown, 1969). Principally hornblende metadiorite and hornblende-quartz metadiorite; includes hornblendite, amphibolite, metaperidotite, orbicular serpentinite, pegmatite, and aplite. Metamorphosed hornblende diorite and hornblende-quartz diorite are dark-grayish-green, medium-grained porphyritic, and massive to crudely-foliated. Phenocrysts are 1 to 10 mm anhedral to subhedral plagioclase of intermediate composition; matrix minerals include hornblende and plagioclase, with variable amounts of biotite and quartz. Accessory minerals include: apatite, zircon, muscovite, magnetite, ilmenite, and pyrrhotite. Epidote, chlorite, and titanite are common secondary minerals. Hornblendites are dark-green, medium- to coarse-grained rocks consisting dominantly of blocky euhedral to subhedral hornblende, with minor interstitial highly altered feldspar, and apatite. Amphibolite and metaperidotite are dark-green coarse grained rocks composed of anhedral pale-green uralitic hornblende which in places contains relict clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene, and rounded blebs of serpentine with cores of acicular tremolite, apparently after olivine. Orbicular serpentinite is dark-gray serpentinite composed of variable amounts of talc, amphibole, and chlorite, with fragmentary remnant pyroxene; the rock contains rouned\u000borbicules from about 2 to 20 cm in diameter. These are composed predominantly of fibrous antigorite, oriented in concentric bands around the periphery, and contain cracks\u000bfilled with magnetite, chlorite, and talc. Pegmatite and aplite are composed of plagioclase, epidote, clinozoisite, muscovite, and quartz; hornblende megacrysts are present in some pegmatite. The complex is generally concordant with the foliation in the enclosing metagraywacke (Czpm), which shows enlarged micas and mica porphryoblasts adjacent to the contact. Structural setting and rock assemblage are suggestive of a layered intrusive sill (Brown, 1969).

Heterogeneous assemblage includes: pebbly to cobbly quartzite and feldspathic metaconglomerate; gray, grayish-pink, or grayish-green, feldspathic quartzite and metasandstone, locally crossbedded; greenish-gray, silvery quartz-sericite-chlorite sandy schist; and, greenish-gray to grayish-red-purple chlorite-sericite tuffaceous phyllite and\u000bslate.

Individual lithologies are laterally discontinuous; formation ranges up to 350 feet in total thickness, but is locally very thin or absent (Gathright, 1976). The Swift Run was originally defined on the northwest limb of the Blue Ridge anticlinorium (Stose and Stose, 1946), where the unit rests unconformably on Grenville-age rocks, and is overlain conformably by the Catoctin Formation; the upper contact is mapped at the bottom of the lowest massive\u000bmetabasalt. In places Swift Run lithologies are interbedded with Catoctin metabasalts, and the contact between the two units is gradational (Gathright, 1976). Swift Run metasedimentary rocks on the northwest limb have been interpreted as deposited in alluvial fan, floodplain, and lacustrine environments (Schwab, 1986); these are interbedded with metamorphosed tuffaceous and volcanoclastic units (Gathright, 1976;\u000bBartholomew, 1977). Although the Swift Run has been interpreted as a thin western equivalent of the Lynchburg Group in the southeastern Blue Ridge (Stose and Stose, 1946; Brown, 1970), some workers have correlated the Swift Run with discontinuous lenses of feldspathic sandstone interbedded with felsic metatuff that occur immediately below the Catoctin on the southeast limb of the anticlinorium (Nelson, 1962; Conley, 1978; 1989; Wehr, 1985).

The Elizabeth River mainstem segment BIBI-ELIPHa was assessed as impaired of the Clean Water Act's Aquatic Life Use Support Goal due to the results of benthic BIBI probabilistic station surveys. The BIBI stressor tool yielded \"unknown\" as the probable impairment source. This segment was previously included (2006 IR) in TMDL ID: VAT-G15E-01-03. \nThe Aquatic Life and Open-Water Aquatic Life Use is impaired based on failure to meet the dissolved oxygen criteria for Open Water - Summer. The Aquatic Life and Open-Water Aquatic Life Use for Rest of Year (ROY) is assessed as insufficient information - previously listed under EPA's 1998 303(d) Overlisting as impaired.  The mainstem Elizabeth River was included in EPA's 1998 303(d) Overlisting as impaired of the Aquatic Life Use; the impairment was attributed to excessive nutrients. During the 2006 cycle, the revised Chesapeake Bay water quality standards were adopted. EPA approved Chesapeake Bay TMDL 12/29/2010.\nThe Fish Consumption Use is impaired based on the VDH fish consumption advisory for PCBs issued 12/13/04 due to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in fish tissue. The advisory recommends that adults eat no more than two meals/month of croaker, gizzard shad, and spot.  High risk individuals such as women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children are advised not to eat any fish contaminated with PCBs.\nAlso exhibits Observed Effects due to the VDH (issued 1988) caution to limit consumption of fish on a daily basis due to the potential for Kepone fish tissue contamination, reported in historical fish monitoring data with the potential for presence in the sediments of the James River. \nThe Wildlife Use is fully supported based on NHx data from the DEQ station 2-ELI002.00. The Recreation Use is fully supported based on Enterococcus bacteria data (0 viol. / 70 obs.) from the station 2-ELI002.00. Shellfishing Use Removed due to the DSS Administrative-Condemnation # 056-007 A (effective 20090518)\n\nSegment added for 2008 IR (split from 2006 IR segment ELI02A06) to match BIBI segment ELIPHa boundary.\n\n1999 CD segment for nutrients (Attachment A, Category 1, Part 2) VAT-G15E-01-03. 1999 CD segment for Tributyltin (Attachment A, Category 1, Part 1) VAT-G15E.\n\nDEQ (AQM) monitoring stations @ 2-ELI002.00.

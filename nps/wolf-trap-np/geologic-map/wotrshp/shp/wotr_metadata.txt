  Description:
    Abstract: The Digital Geologic Map of Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts and Vicinity, Virginia is composed of GIS data layers complete with ArcMap 9.3 layer (.LYR) files, two ancillary GIS tables, a Map PDF document with ancillary map text, figures and tables, a FGDC metadata record and a 9.3 ArcMap (.MXD) Document that displays the digital map in 9.3 ArcGIS.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Inventory (GRI) program, a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  Source geologic maps and data used to complete this GRI digital dataset were provided by the following: U.S. Geological Survey.  Detailed information concerning the sources used and their contribution the GRI product are listed in the Source Citation sections(s) of this metadata record (wotr_metadata.txt; available at http://nrdata.nps.gov/wotr/nrdata/geology/gis/wotr_metadata.xml).  All GIS and ancillary tables were produced as per the NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.1. (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm).  The GIS data is available as a 9.3 personal geodatabase (wotr_geology.mdb), and as shapefile (.SHP) and DBASEIV (.DBF) table files.  The GIS data projection is NAD83, UTM Zone 18N.  The data is within the area of interest of Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts.
    Purpose: The data are intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts.
    Supplemental_Information: The data layers (feature classes) that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts and Vicinity, Virginia include: WOTRGLG (Geologic Units), WOTRGLGA (Geologic Contacts), WOTRSUR (Surficial Units) and WOTRSURA (Surficial Contacts).  There are three additional ancillary map components, the Geologic Unit Information (NCAPUNIT) Table, the Source Map Information (NCAPMAP) Table and the Map PDF Document (ncap_geology.pdf).  Refer to the NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.1 (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm) for detailed data layer (feature class) and table specifications including attribute field parameters, definitions and domains, and implemented topology rules and relationship classes.

      Source_Contribution: Features and attribution were derived from source digital data.  Ancillary map text, including unit descriptions, and graphics, if present on the source map, were captured, formatted and added to the map-related pdf document.  See the Process Step section for additional information.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 1.) GIS features were produced from source digital data.  See the Source Information Contribution section(s) for specific source map details.  GIS features were imported into a geodatabase as per the GRI data model.  Topology rules were then imposed and validated, as per the GRI data model, to check for and correct topology errors.  Quality control (QC) consisting of a visual check and/or queries of the data against its source (where applicable), as well as running a GRI developed script (QC_Script) to check for GRI data model validation and feature-related consistency, was conducted.  2.) GIS table attribution was derived and checked using the source digital data file(s).  Relationship classes were also used to ensure attribution consistency between feature class and table attribution.  For details on the GRI data model see the NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.3.1 (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm).  3.) GIS feature classes were then exported from the geodatabase to shapefile (.SHP) format, and GIS tables exported from the geodatabase to DBASEIV (.DBF) format.  4.) The map-related pdf document, see the Supplemental Information section for additional information, was produced from textual information and figures present on the source map(s) and/or in digital data files.  If applicable, source map images were produced at 150dpi or greater resolution and optical character recognition (OCR) software was used to produce text from source map text.  The text, source map images and other ancillary source map information were added to a Help & Manual (.HMX) template file.  The Help & Manual (.HMX) file was then compiled to produce the .PDF map document.  Any compilation errors were then checked and corrected and the document was reviewed for content, usability and grammatical errors.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 1.) GIS data in 9.1 geodatabase format in the NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.3.1 was migrated to a 9.3 personal geodatabase consisting of "empty" NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.1 schema. 2.) Data model topology was then added and validated, and any topological errors corrected.  If applicable, additional attribute fields were populated from already existing attribution or by using the source map. 3.) GIS feature classes were then exported from the geodatabase to shapefile (.SHP) format, and GIS tables exported from the geodatabase to DBASEIV (.DBF) format.  4.) The map-related PDF document was produced from textual information and figures present on the source maps.  This information was initially captured in a GRI formatted Windows Help (.HLP) file.  This file was imported into a template Help & Manual (.HMX) file and reformatted and edited, then compiled to produce the .PDF map document.  Additional information, if available from existing or new source maps, was then added.  Any compilation errors were then checked and corrected and the document was reviewed for content, usability and grammatical errors.

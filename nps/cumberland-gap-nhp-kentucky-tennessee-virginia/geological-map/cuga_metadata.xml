<abstract>The Digital Geologic Map of Cumberland Gap National Historical Park and Vicinity, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia is composed of GIS data layers complete with ArcMap 9.2 layer (.LYR) files, two ancillary GIS tables, a Windows Help File with ancillary map text, figures and tables, a FGDC metadata record and a 9.2 ArcMap (.MXD) Document that displays the digital map in 9.2 ArcGIS.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resource Evaluation (GRE) program, a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&amp;M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  Source geologic maps and data used to complete this GRE digital dataset were provided by the following: .  Detailed information concerning the sources used and their contribution the GRE product are listed in the Source Citation sections(s) of this metadata record (cuga_metadata.txt; available at http://nrdata.nps.gov/cuga/nrdata/geology/gis/cuga_metadata.xml).  All GIS and ancillary tables were produced as per the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.0. (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm).  The GIS data is available as a 9.2 personal geodatabase (cuga_geology.mdb), and as shapefile (.SHP) and DBASEIV (.DBF) table files.  The GIS data projection is NAD83, UTM Zone 17N.  That data is within the area of interest of Cumberland Gap National Historical Park.</abstract>
<purpose>The data are intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Cumberland Gap National Historical Park.</purpose>
<supplinf>The data layers (feature classes) that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Cumberland Gap National Historical Park and Vicinity, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia include: CUGAGLG (Geologic Units), CUGAGLGA (Geologic Contacts), CUGAGLN (Linear Geologic Units), CUGAGPT (Fossil Localities), CUGAGPF (Coal Outcrops), CUGASEC (Geologic Cross Section Lines), CUGASUR (Surficial Units), CUGASURA (Surficial Contacts), CUGAATD (Geologic Attitude and Observation Localities), CUGACN1 (Structure Contours, Base Fire Clay Coal Bed), CUGAFLD (Folds), CUGAFLT (Faults), CUGASYM (Map Symbology), CUGAMAF (Mine Area Features), CUGAMAFA (Mine Area Feature Boundaries), CUGAMFL (Mine Feature Lines), CUGAMIN (Mine Point Features), CUGACN2 (Structure Contours, Base Manchester Coal Bed), CUGACN3 (Structure Contours, Base Upper Elkhorn No. 2 (Jellico) Coal Bed) and CUGACN4 (Structure Contours, Top Upper Elkhorn No. 2 (Jellico) Coal Bed).  There are three additional ancillary map components, the Geologic Unit Information (CUGAUNIT) Table, the Source Map Information (CUGAMAP) Table and the Map Help File (cuga_geology.hlp).  Refer to the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.0 (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm) for detailed data layer (feature class) and table specifications including attribute field parameters, definitions and domains, and implemented topology rules and relationship classes.</supplinf>

<horizpa>
<horizpar>Data, produced from digital source data and digitized from a georeferenced MrSID image downloaded from the Kentucky Geological Survey (http://www.uky.edu/KGS/gis/gqmaps/index.html) or from a 300 dpi georeferenced .tif image, is assumed to meet National Map Accuracy Standards.  The PRECISION of the Export (.E00) file and Shapefile (.SHP) file is DOUBLE.  When features were digitized from the MrSID image, care was taken to align the digitized features with the source digital data if discrepancies were noted, as the digital data was originally digitized from a more stable base (mylar).  The PRECISION of any Shapefile (.SHP) files is DOUBLE.  Coordinate tics on the georeferenced (registered and rectified) source map image(s) were checked against control points that had the exact specified coordinates of the tic.  The direct distance between the image tic and its control point were measured.  All measured distances were less than 50% of the required distance to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (1/50th of an inch for maps at 1:20,000 scale and smaller).  Features were checked (QCd) after digitizing for positional accuracy errors using the georeferenced source map image.</horizpar>

<procstep>
<procdesc>1.) GIS features were produced from source digital data or digitized from scanned source paper maps or MrSID images.  See the Source Information Contribution section(s) for specific source map details.  GIS features converted from source digital data were imported into a geodatabase as per the GRE data model.  GIS features captured from a scanned source paper map were digitized from a .TIF image of the paper map that was scanned at 300dpi and georeferenced in NAD83 UTM.  These GIS features were first digitized into a digitizing geodatabase with limited attribution and topological rules.  Line quality was checked against the source scan to ensure that GIS features were represented accurately, both positionally and spatially. These features were then parsed using a GRE developed script (Genesis) into their appropriate GRE data model feature classes (data layers) within a new geodatabase, and further attributed.  Topology rules were imposed and validated on all GIS data, as per the GRE data model, to check for and correct topology errors.  Quality control (QC) consisting of a visual check and/or queries of the data against its source (where applicable), as well as running a GRE developed script (QC_Script) to check for GRE data model validation and feature-related consistency, was conducted.  2.) GIS table attribution was derived and checked using the source map(s) and/or digital data file(s).  Relationship classes were also used to ensure attribution consistency between feature class and table attribution.  For details on the GRE data model see the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.0 (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm).  3.) GIS feature classes were then exported from the geodatabase to shapefile (.SHP) format, and GIS tables exported from the geodatabase to DBASEIV (.DBF) format.  4.) The map-related help file, see the Supplemental Information section for additional information, was produced from textual information and figures present on the source map(s) and/or in digital data files.  If applicable, source map images were produced at 150dpi or greater resolution and optical character recognition (OCR) software was used to produce text from source map text.  The text, source map images and other ancillary source map information were added to a Help &amp; Manual (.HMX) template file.  Help file pages were organized based on topic and links and keywords were added to enhance usability.  The Help &amp; Manual (.HMX) file was then compiled to produce the .HLP help file.  Any compilation errors were then checked and corrected and the help file was reviewed for content, usability and grammatical errors.</procdesc>

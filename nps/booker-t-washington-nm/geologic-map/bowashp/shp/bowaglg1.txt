  Description:
    Abstract: The Digital Geologic Unit Information (GLG1) Table consists of information concerning geologic units present in the digital geologic data for the Digital Geologic Map of Booker T. Washington National Monument and Vicinity, Virginia.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Evaluation (GRE) program, a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  The data were attributed as per the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.4. (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm).  The data is available as a table in a 9.1 personal geodatabase (bowa_geology.mdb).  The table is also available as a table export (.E00) file (BOWAGLG1.E00), and as a DBASEIV (.DBF) table file (BOWAGLG1.DBF).
    Purpose: Data intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Booker T. Washington National Monument.
    Supplemental_Information: This dataset is just one component of the Digital Geologic Map of Booker T. Washington National Monument and Vicinity, Virginia.  The data layers (feature classes) that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Booker T. Washington National Monument and Vicinity, Virginia include: BOWAATD (Geologic Attitude and Observation Points), BOWAFLD (Folds), BOWAFLT (Faults), BOWAGLG (Geologic Units), BOWAGLGA (Geologic Contacts) and BOWASYM (Fault, Fold and Other Map Symbology).  There are three additional ancillary map components, the Geologic Unit Information (BOWAGLG1) Table, the Source Map Information (BOWAMAP) Table and the Map Help File (BOWA_GEOLOGY.HLP).  Refer to the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.4 (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm) for detailed table specifications including attribute field parameters, definitions and domains, and relationship classes.

      Source_Contribution: Features were derived from source data produced by the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy - Division of Mineral Resources.  Source data attribution was used to attribute features, as per the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.3.1.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Table attribution was derived and checked using the source map(s).  Relationship classes were also used to ensure attribution consistency.  See the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.4 (available at http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm) for more details.  Tables were exported from the geodatabase to INFO table and DBASEIV (.DBF) formats.

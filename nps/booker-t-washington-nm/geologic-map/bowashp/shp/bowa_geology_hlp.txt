  Description:
    Abstract: The BOWA_GEOLOGY.HLP help file is an accessory component for the Digital Geologic Map of Booker T. Washington National Monument and Vicinity, Virginia.  The file was completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Evaluation (GRE) program, a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  The file contains textual and graphical figure information present on the source geologic map(s).  NPS GIS-Geology Geodatabase Data Model data layers with geologic unit information present rely upon this accessory help file to present additional geologic unit descriptions and a correlation of geologic units, as well as other unit text and related figures.  The help file also typically contains reference citations that are present on the source map(s) as well as any map notes, author notes and ancillary text and figures.  Other NPS GIS-Geology Geodatabase Data Model data layers may also have relevant information within the help file (e.g. faulting, jointing, radiometric dating etc.) if this information is present on the source map(s).
    Purpose: Data intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Booker T. Washington National Monument.
    Supplemental_Information: This dataset is just one component of the Digital Geologic Map of Booker T. Washington National Monument and Vicinity, Virginia.  The data layers (feature classes) that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Booker T. Washington National Monument and Vicinity, Virginia include: BOWAATD (Geologic Attitude and Observation Points), BOWAFLD (Folds), BOWAFLT (Faults), BOWAGLG (Geologic Units), BOWAGLGA (Geologic Contacts) and BOWASYM (Fault, Fold and Other Map Symbology).  There are three additional ancillary map components, the Geologic Unit Information (BOWAGLG1) Table, the Source Map Information (BOWAMAP) Table and the Map Help File (BOWA_GEOLOGY.HLP).  Refer to the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.4 (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm) for detailed data layer (feature class) and table specifications including attribute field parameters, definitions and domains, and implemented topology rules and relationship classes.

      Source_Contribution: Features were derived from source data produced by the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy - Division of Mineral Resources.  Source data attribution was used to attribute features, as per the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.4.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: A paper copy of Va Division of Mineral Resources Publication 146 (1997)  was scanned  at 300 ppi. The lines were "heads-up" digitized using Abicas software. The line data were attributed. A second copy of the file was created and all non-connecting lines were removed. This second file was used to create polygons which were then attributed with the formation symbol of the geologic unit represented by the polygon.  A map was created from the data to check the digitizing and attribution.  The line data was converted to ESRI shapefiles and additional attribution added.  Data was reviewed in ESRI ArcMap 8.1.

      Process_Description: The BOWA_GEOLOGY.HLP help file was produced from textual information and figures present on the source map(s) that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Booker T. Washington National Monument and Vicinity, Virginia.  If applicable, source map images were produced at 150dpi or greater resolution and optical character recognition (OCR) software was used to produce text from source map text.  The text, source map images and other ancillary source map information were added to a Help & Manual (.HMX) template file.  Help file pages were organized based on topic and links and keywords were added to enhance usability.  The Help & Manual (.HMX) file was then compiled to produce the .HLP help file.  Any compilation errors were then checked and corrected and the help file was reviewed for content, usability and grammatical errors.

  Description:
    Abstract: The Digital Geologic Attitude and Observation Points of Booker T. Washington National Monument and Vicinity, Virginia consists of geologic attitude and fault measurement observations (localities) mapped as point features.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Evaluation (GRE) program, a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  The data were captured, grouped and attributed as per the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.4. (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm).  The data layer is available as a feature class in a 9.1 personal geodatabase (bowa_geology.mdb).  The Geologic Attitude and Observation Points (BOWAATD) GIS data layer is also available as a coverage export (.E00) file (BOWAATD.E00), and as a shapefile (.SHP) file (BOWAATD.SHP).  Each GIS data format has an ArcGIS 9.1 layer (.LYR) file (BOWAATD_GDB.LYR (geodatabase feature class), BOWAATD_COV.LYR (coverage), BOWAATD_SHP.LYR (shapefile) with map symbology that is included with the GIS data.  See the Distribution Information section for additional information on data acquisition.  The GIS data projection is NAD83, UTM Zone 17N.  The data is within the area of interest of Booker T. Washington National Monument.
    Purpose: The data are intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Booker T. Washington National Monument.
    Supplemental_Information: This dataset is just one component of the Digital Geologic Map of Booker T. Washington National Monument and Vicinity, Virginia.  The data layers (feature classes) that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Booker T. Washington National Monument and Vicinity, Virginia include: BOWAATD (Geologic Attitude and Observation Points), BOWAFLD (Folds), BOWAFLT (Faults), BOWAGLG (Geologic Units), BOWAGLGA (Geologic Contacts) and BOWASYM (Fault, Fold and Other Map Symbology).  There are three additional ancillary map components, the Geologic Unit Information (BOWAGLG1) Table, the Source Map Information (BOWAMAP) Table and the Map Help File (BOWA_GEOLOGY.HLP).  Refer to the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.4 (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm) for detailed data layer (feature class) and table specifications including attribute field parameters, definitions and domains, and implemented topology rules and relationship classes.

      Source_Contribution: Features were derived from source data produced by the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy - Division of Mineral Resources.  Source data attribution was used to attribute features, as per the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.4.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: A paper copy of Va Division of Mineral Resources Publication 146 (1997)  was scanned  at 300 ppi. The lines were "heads-up" digitized using Abicas software. The line data were attributed. A second copy of the file was created and all non-connecting lines were removed. This second file was used to create polygons which were then attributed with the formation symbol of the geologic unit represented by the polygon.  A map was created from the data to check the digitizing and attribution.  The line data was converted to ESRI shapefiles and additional attribution added.  Data was reviewed in ESRI ArcMap 8.1.

      Process_Description: Features were produced from Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy - Division of Mineral Resources (CVDMME-DMR) digital source data.  Digital source data attribution was used to attribute features as per the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.4.  Data Model topological rules were imposed on polygon and line feature classes, as well as with several point features classes.  Positional accuracy was checked with a georeferenced CVDMME-DMR Publication 148 image. Features and table and feature attribution not found in the CVDMME-DMR Unpublished digital source data were captured and derived from CVDMME-DMR Publication 148.  Relationship classes were also used to ensure attribution consistency.  Features were exported from the geodatabase to coverage and shapefile (.SHP) formats.  Tables were exported from the geodatabase to INFO table and DBASEIV (.DBF) formats.  See the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.4 (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm) for more details.  Features were exported from the geodatabase to coverage and shapefile (.SHP) formats.

Unpublished Digital Geologic Map of Shenandoah National Park and Vicinity, Virginia (NPS, GRD, GRI, SHEN, SHEN digital map) adpated from the U.S. Geological Survey Open-File map by Southworth, Aleinikoff, Bailey, Burton, Crider, Hackley, Smoot and Tollo (2009)

<dt><em>Abstract:</em>  
<dd>

The Unpublished Digital Geologic Map of Shenandoah National Park and Vicinity, Virginia is composed of GIS data layers complete with ArcMap 9.3 layer (.LYR) files, two ancillary GIS tables, a Map PDF document with ancillary map text, figures and tables, a FGDC metadata record and a 9.3 ArcMap (.MXD) Document that displays the digital map in 9.3 ArcGIS.  The data is also available as a 2.2 KMZ/KML file for use in Google Earth.  Google Earth software is available for free at: <a href="http://www.google.com/earth/index.html">&lt;http://www.google.com/earth/index.html&gt;</a>.  Users are encouraged to only use the Google Earth data for basic visualization, and to use the GIS data for any type of data analysis or investigation.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Inventory (GRI) program, a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&amp;M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  Source geologic maps and data used to complete this GRI digital dataset were provided by the following: U.S. Geological Survey.  Detailed information concerning the sources used and their contribution the GRI product are listed in the Source Citation sections(s) of this metadata record (shen_metadata.txt; available at <a href="http://nrdata.nps.gov/shen/nrdata/geology/gis/shen_metadata.xml">&lt;http://nrdata.nps.gov/shen/nrdata/geology/gis/shen_metadata.xml&gt;</a>).  Users of this data are cautioned about the locational accuracy of features within this dataset.  Based on the source map scale of 1:24,000 and United States National Map Accuracy Standards features are within (horizontally) 50.8 meters or 166.7 feet of their actual location as presented by this dataset.  Users of this data should thus not assume the location of features is exactly where they are portrayed in Google Earth, ArcGIS or other software used to display this dataset.  All GIS and ancillary tables were produced as per the NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.1. (available at: <a href="http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm">&lt;http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm&gt;</a>).  The GIS data is available as a 9.3 personal geodatabase (shen_geology.mdb), and as shapefile (.SHP) and DBASEIV (.DBF) table files.  The GIS data projection is NAD83, UTM Zone 17N, however, for the KML/KMZ format the data is projected upon export to WGS84 Geographic, the native coordinate system used by Google Earth.  That data is within the area of interest of Shenandoah National Park.

1.) GIS features were produced from source digital data.  See the Source Information Contribution section(s) for specific source map details.  GIS features were imported into a geodatabase as per the GRI data model.  Topology rules were then imposed and validated, as per the GRI data model, to check for and correct topology errors.  Quality control (QC) consisting of a visual check and/or queries of the data against its source (where applicable), as well as running a GRI developed script (QC_Script) to check for GRI data model validation and feature-related consistency, was conducted.  2.) GIS table attribution was derived and checked using the source digital data file(s).  Relationship classes were also used to ensure attribution consistency between feature class and table attribution.  For details on the GRI data model see the NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.1 (available at: <a href="http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm">&lt;http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm&gt;</a>).  3.) GIS feature classes were then exported from the geodatabase to shapefile (.SHP) format, and GIS tables exported from the geodatabase to DBASEIV (.DBF) format.  4.) The map-related pdf document, see the Supplemental Information section for additional information, was produced from textual information and figures present on the source map(s) and/or in digital data files.  If applicable, source map images were produced at 150dpi or greater resolution.  The text, source map images and other ancillary source map information were added to a Help &amp; Manual (.HMX) template file.  The Help &amp; Manual (.HMX) file was then compiled to produce the .PDF map document.  Any compilation errors were then checked and corrected and the document was reviewed for content, usability and grammatical errors.  KML/KMZ files were then produced with key table fields appended to each data layer prior to export.

Not for use at scale greater than 1:100,000 (source map scale).  Users of this data are cautioned about the locational accuracy of features within this dataset.  Based on the source map scale and United States National Map Accuracy Standards features are within (horizontally) 50.8 meters or 166.7 feet of their actual location as presented by this dataset.  Users of this data should thus not assume the location of features is exactly where they portrayed are in Google Earth, ArcGIS or other software used to display this dataset.

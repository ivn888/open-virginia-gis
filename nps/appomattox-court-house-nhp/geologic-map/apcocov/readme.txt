README.TXT

Data within the associated WINZIP 9.0 .ZIP file consists of GIS spatial data and accessory data files.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resource Evaluation (GRE) program, a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).

In addition to this README.TXT file, data within a GRE download .ZIP file includes: 

- GIS spatial data layers, either as feature classes in a 9.1 personal geodatabase, as an ArcInfo .E00 (export) file or as Shapefile (.SHP) files,
- FGDC format data layer metadata (.TXT and .XML) file(s).  Metadata exists in a 9.1 personal geodatabase as well,
- Ancillary Geologic Unit Information (GLG1) and Source Map Information (MAP) tables (either as tables in a 9.1 personal geodatabase, as an ArcInfo .E00 (export) file or as DBASEIV (.DBF) files,
- Windows Help (.HLP) file with ancillary source data information (apco_geology.hlp)
- FGDC format ancillary table and help file metadata (.TXT) files,
- geologic cross section graphic (.JPG) file(s) (if applicable),
- ArcGIS 9.1 layer (.LYR) files,
- ArcGIS 9.1 ArcMap Document (.MXD). GIS source data is set to the personal geodatabase (apco_geology.mdb)


WINZIP (.ZIP) GRE download file names ending in GDB (e.g. APCOGDB.ZIP) have spatial data in a 9.1 personal geodatabase, whereas those ending with COV (e.g. APCOCOV.ZIP) have spatial data as ArcInfo Export (.E00) files, and those files ending in SHP (e.g. APCOSHP.ZIP) have spatial data as Shapefile (.SHP) files.

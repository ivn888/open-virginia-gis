  Description:
    Abstract: The Digital Geologic Unit Information (GLG1) Table consists of information concerning geologic units present on related digital geologic data produced for Appomattox Court House National Historical Park.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resource Evaluation (GRE) program, a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  The data were attributed as per the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.4. (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm).  The data is available as a table in a 9.1 personal geodatabase (apco_geology.mdb).  The table is also available as a table export (.E00) file (APCOGLG1.E00), and as a DBASEIV (.DBF) table file (APCOGLG1.DBF).
    Purpose: Data intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Appomattox Court House National Historical Park.
    Supplemental_Information: This dataset is just one component of the Digital Geologic Map of Appomattox Court House National Historical Park and Vicinity, Virginia.  The data layers (feature classes) that comprise the Digital Geologic Map of Appomattox Court House National Historical Park and Vicinity, Virginia include: APCODKE (Linear Dikes), APCOFLT (Faults), APCOGLG (Geologic Units) and APCOGLGA (Geologic Contacts).  There are three additional ancillary map components, the Geologic Unit Information (APCOGLG1) Table, the Source Map Information (APCOMAP) Table and the Map Help File (apco_geology.hlp).  Refer to the NPS GRE Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 1.4 (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm) for detailed table specifications including attribute field parameters, definitions and domains, and relationship classes.
